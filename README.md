# Vehicle-Speed-Detection-Using-YOLO-and-OpenCV
This project uses YOLO object detection, OpenCV, and basic line-crossing logic to detect vehicles, track their movement across two lines in a video feed, and estimate their speed. Itâ€™s suitable for traffic analysis, smart surveillance systems, and transport research applications.

# ðŸš— Vehicle Speed Detection Using YOLO and OpenCV

This project estimates the speed of vehicles using a video feed by applying object detection with YOLO, tracking their movement across two virtual lines (red and blue), and calculating their speed based on time taken to cross the lines. It visualizes results in real-time and stores processed frames.
