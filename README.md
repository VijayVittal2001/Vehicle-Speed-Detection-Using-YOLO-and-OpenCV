# Vehicle-Speed-Detection-Using-YOLO-and-OpenCV
This project uses YOLO object detection, OpenCV, and basic line-crossing logic to detect vehicles, track their movement across two lines in a video feed, and estimate their speed. Itâ€™s suitable for traffic analysis, smart surveillance systems, and transport research applications.
